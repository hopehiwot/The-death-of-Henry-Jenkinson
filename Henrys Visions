Henry was a tenacious lad who grew up on the western coast of Dublin. 
The unfortanate part was even though he had a  nice place to call home he was so delirious he believed his lived in albuquerque NM.
Therefore everytime he would get lost he would tell people trying to help where he thought he lived. 
Eventually he was relocated to where he believed was home which was done to try and ease his "visions".
